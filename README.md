# Chicken n' Egg

Another introductory presentation on Erlang, focusing on programming idioms, thinking in Erlang, and getting started with simple projects.

Presented using S9/Slideshow.

To install S9/Slideshow and the S6 theme:

    sudo gem install slideshow
    slideshow -f http://github.com/geraldb/slideshow-s6-syntax-highlighter/raw/master/s6syntax.txt

To generate the slides:
